Project work for NIELIT course (Course ID: 1920-5201-40-02)
Project work done by : Bishal Biswas (Student ID : 1920-5201-40-02-002) 
Course Name: CC Python with Linux (80 hours)
Project Target: Development of an app/UI using Tkinter and Python(2.7.x specifically) that has the capacity to interact with user on the
frontend and files in the rearend. App must have capacity to take in input, process if possible and then store the changes in files.
App must also be able to import data directly from files and bring it to the front for the user to see and administer changes.

Startup point: windowControl.py
File Descriptions:


***Caution: never remove the files of type .txt --- infoDB.txt, userInfo.txt, UserDetails.txt
These files are a very integral part of the UI and is important for the operation of the UI. Removing or Renaming these files 
could and will generate fatal errors and may stop the UI completely from even a small operation.
